The binary classifiers and trained and evaluated are as follows:
1. Perceptron
2. SVM
3. Logistic Regression
4. Multinomial naive bayes
5. Decision trees


## Running code.
`python train_main.py` <br/>
We need `scikit-learn` and `python2` to run code.


## Results.
* Raw results are in `train_result.txt`
* A summary of project and results can be found in `Presentation.pdf`.
* Detailed report is in `Report.pdf`
